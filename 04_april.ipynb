    "* A decision tree is a tree-structured classifier that is used for both classification and regression problems. It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions. It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to build a tree, we use the CART algorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression Tree algorithm. A decision tree simply asks a question, and based on the answer (Yes/No), it further splits the tree into subtrees. The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset. The internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.\n",
