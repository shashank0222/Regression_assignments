    "Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that is used to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. In ordinary least squares regression (OLS), the coefficients are chosen to minimize the sum of squared residuals. In Ridge regression, an additional term is added to the cost function that penalizes large values of the coefficients. This penalty term is controlled by a regularization parameter λ, which determines how much the coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge regression and OLS is that Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the cost function that shrinks the coefficients towards zero. This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. In contrast, OLS does not add a penalty term and can lead to overfitting if there are too many features in the data."
