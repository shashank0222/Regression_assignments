    "The \"train,\" \"test,\" and \"validation\" split is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning. It involves dividing a dataset into three distinct subsets for different purposes during model development and evaluation. Here's an explanation of each term and its importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose: The training set is the largest portion of the dataset, and it is used to train the machine learning model. During training, the model learns the underlying patterns, relationships, and features in the data.\n",

    "* Validation Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Purpose: The validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and monitor its performance during training. It acts as an intermediate evaluation step before applying the model to the test data.\n",
    "2. Importance: The validation set helps prevent overfitting, a situation where the model becomes too specialized in the training data and performs poorly on unseen data. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, you can make necessary adjustments to the model's hyperparameters to achieve better generalization.\n",
    "* Test Set:\n",

    "1. Purpose: The test set is a completely independent dataset that is not used during model training or hyperparameter tuning. It serves as the final evaluation step to assess the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "2. Importance: The test set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to make predictions on new, real-world data. It ensures that the model is not simply memorizing the training data (overfitting) and can generalize effectively."
