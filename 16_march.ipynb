    "**Overfitting** occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and tries to cover all the data points or more than the required data points present in the given dataset. This leads to the model learning the noise and inaccurate values present in the dataset, reducing its efficiency and accuracy. The overfitted model has low bias and high variance.\n",

    "The consequences of overfitting include poor generalization to new data points and poor predictions on new data. To mitigate overfitting, some strategies include:\n",
    "- Increasing training data\n",
    "- Reducing model complexity\n",
    "- Early stopping during the training phase\n",
    "- Regularization\n",
    "- Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **underfitting** occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture data complexities. It represents the inability of the model to learn the training data effectively, resulting in poor performance both on the training and testing data. The underfit model has high bias and low variance.\n",

    "Overfitting and underfitting are common issues in machine learning models. Here are some methods to detect and handle them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train/Test Split and Cross-Validation**: The most common way to detect overfitting and underfitting is by splitting the dataset into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, it’s likely overfitting. If it performs poorly on both, it’s likely underfitting. Cross-validation, such as k-fold cross-validation, can provide a more robust way to check for overfitting and underfitting by averaging the model’s performance over different partitions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning Curves**: Learning curves plot the model’s performance on both the training and validation set as a function of the training set size or iteration. If the model is underfitting, both curves will converge to a high error. If the model is overfitting, there will be a large gap between the curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity Curves**: Complexity curves plot the model’s performance on both the training and validation set as a function of model complexity (like degree of polynomial for a polynomial regression model). If a model is underfitting, it will perform poorly for all degrees of complexity. If a model is overfitting, the training error will decrease as complexity increases, but validation error will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, detecting overfitting and underfitting is part of an iterative process of model building and evaluation. It’s important to understand your data, question assumptions, and adjust your model as necessary."
